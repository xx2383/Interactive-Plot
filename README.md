# Interactive-Plot
Animated Map

Some instructions:

You can see my work by opening these two files: try.html, stateMap.html
	The first one is for homework requirement and the second one is for bonus point.

For try.html, you can highlight the graph by clicking the lines, and off the highlight by double clicking somewhere else on the plot. 
You can hide lines by clicking the “Hide Lines” button. To see any particular lines, you can double click the legend to hide all the 
lines except for the one that you chose, and then choose any additional line you want by clicking them. 

For stateMap.html, a red color means a relatively good condition of the county; a green color means a relatively bad condition of the county. 
You may need to wait for 30 seconds to notice some apparent color changes, because all the counties are in a “good” condition at the beginning.
